<p><br>In electronics, a remote control (also known as a remote or clicker[1]) is an electronic device used to operate another device from a distance,</br>
<p>busually wirelessly. In consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player or other home appliance.</br>
 A remote control can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.</br>
 They function best when used from a short distance.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is primarily a convenience feature for the user. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside.


The standard symbol used to denote that it uses infrared as a way to send the signal to devices
Early television remote controls (1956–1977) used ultrasonic tones. Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of 
infrared radiation. They control functions such as power, volume, channels, playback, track change, heat, fan speed, and various other features. Remote controls
 for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects with an array of buttons.</br>
 <br>They are used to adjust various settings such as television channel,
 track number, and volume. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line. However, there are 
 universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.

Remote controls in the 2000s include Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity, motion sensor-enabled capabilities and voice control.[2][3] Remote controls for 2010s onward Smart TVs may feature a standalone keyboard on the rear side to facilitate typing, and be usable as a pointing device.[4]
